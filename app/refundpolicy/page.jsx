      <p>
        If the refund is approved, the amount will be automatically refunded to your original payment method within 25 business days.
      </p>

      <h2>Enrollment & Payment Terms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The monthly standard fee is ₹47,500, non-negotiable, and starts from the date of booking/payment.</li>
        <li>No discount or negotiation shall be considered unless provided officially in writing by the institution.</li>
        <li>A client availing a 1-year offer must pay the entire discounted amount within 45 days of booking.</li>
        <li>Failure to pay within 45 days automatically cancels the offer, and the monthly rate of ₹47,500 applies retroactively.</li>
        <li>Installments (if approved) must be paid on or before the due date. Late payments incur a ₹2,000 penalty per week.</li>
        <li>Monthly renewal must be done on the same calendar day as the original booking day.</li>
        <li>All services are prepaid. No postpaid arrangements are entertained.</li>
        <li>If the client pays partial fees and delays, the training may be paused until full payment is received.</li>
        <li>No slot is confirmed without payment, even if verbal or written communication exists.</li>
        <li>A fee receipt and policy confirmation will be provided upon payment for transparency.</li>
        <li>Online payments must be verified before training begins; screenshots alone are not sufficient proof.</li>
        <li>Fee once paid is non-transferable and non-adjustable to another person or program.</li>
        <li>Rejoining after a break of 30+ days is treated as a new enrollment, subject to availability and updated fees.</li>
        <li>All offers are non-transferable between programs or individuals.</li>
        <li>MasterPramod.com reserves the right to update pricing, and new clients must comply with current prices.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Daily Training & Attendance Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each calendar day is counted in the plan duration — whether a session is conducted or not.</li>
        <li>Our training is customized; light sessions, outdoor activities, mindset sessions are counted as valid training days.</li>
        <li>Absenteeism by the client without prior notice will be considered unexcused and non-refundable.</li>
        <li>Clients must maintain 80% attendance to remain in their fixed time slot.</li>
        <li>No make-up sessions are guaranteed for missed classes unless approved in advance.</li>
        <li>Training days lost due to client travel or personal issues will not be adjusted or extended.</li>
        <li>If MasterPramod.com fails to deliver more than 5 sessions in a month, extra sessions will be compensated.</li>
        <li>Public holidays or trainer travel days are counted as training days and included in the plan.</li>
        <li>A weekly attendance sheet is maintained for all clients.</li>
        <li>Clients should notify absence at least 24 hours in advance.</li>
        <li>Repeated absenteeism may result in automatic removal from the batch without refund.</li>
        <li>If a student consistently misses 3+ sessions/month, they lose the right to fixed slots.</li>
        <li>Personal excuses (family events, mood, other work) are not considered valid for rescheduling.</li>
        <li>Students who fail to show up for 7 consecutive days without notice will be marked inactive.</li>
        <li>Session timings are strict. Entry beyond 10 minutes late may result in session cancellation.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Exit, Withdrawal & Batch Change Policy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To exit, clients must submit a formal request at least 45 days in advance.</li>
        <li>Exit requests submitted within 10 days of the next payment date will not be considered.</li>
        <li>Failing to give 45-day notice will result in mandatory payment of 45 extra days to fill your slot.</li>
        <li>All exit requests must be in writing via email or WhatsApp, not verbal.</li>
        <li>No refunds are issued for mid-month exits or voluntary withdrawal.</li>
        <li>Clients exiting in 30 or 60 days after taking an annual plan or six month plan must pay per-month charges at ₹47,500/month.</li>
        <li>Batch change requests must also follow a 45-day notice policy.</li>
        <li>A new batch is subject to availability and approval, not guaranteed.</li>
        <li>Multiple batch change requests (more than once) may not be entertained.</li>
        <li>If a new slot is not available, the client may be asked to wait or continue in the old batch.</li>
        <li>If the client insists on an urgent batch change, a batch shifting fee of ₹5,000 applies.</li>
        <li>Quitting due to temporary relocation, workload, or lack of motivation is not considered valid for refund.</li>
        <li>Clients who leave and want to rejoin must start a fresh plan at new rates.</li>
        <li>No balance transfer is allowed to the next month if the exit process starts.</li>
        <li>We reserve the right to refuse exit in golden time slots unless full terms are met.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Golden Time Slot Policy (6–9 AM)</h2>
